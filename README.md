# Telex Monetization & AI Credit System

## 🌍 Overview
The **Telex Monetization & AI Credit System** introduces a new way for developers and users to interact with Telex’s AI-powered features through a transparent and flexible **credit-based model**.  
This system allows developers to **earn** from their integrations and enables users to **pay-as-they-use** AI features — making the Telex ecosystem more sustainable and scalable.

---

## 🚀 What It Does
- Allows users to **purchase AI credits** using integrated payment gateways (Paystack & Stripe).  
- Tracks credit usage across different Telex AI endpoints.  
- Enables developers to **earn revenue** based on the consumption of their AI modules.  
- Provides a **dashboard** for viewing balances, transactions, and usage statistics.  
- Ensures **secure transactions** and transparent credit deductions per API call.

With the AI Credit System:
