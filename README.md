# 💳 Telex Monetization & AI Credit System

### Empowering Productivity Through Smarter Credit Usage

---

## 🧠 Overview
The **Telex Monetization & AI Credit System** introduces a new way for Telex users to **earn, purchase, and manage credits** for accessing AI-powered tools and premium features—bringing sustainable monetization to the Telex ecosystem.

This module provides a **flexible, transparent credit-based economy**, giving both individual and enterprise users control over how they consume Telex AI services, just like Slack’s credit and billing model — but smarter, more accessible, and data-driven.

---

## 🎯 Why It Matters
AI-driven collaboration platforms are growing fast, but users struggle with:
- **Unclear usage billing** (hidden costs and unpredictable limits)
- **Limited monetization opportunities** for workspace owners
- **Lack of reward systems** that encourage platform engagement

The Telex Monetization & AI Credit System solves this by:
✅ Introducing **clear AI credit pricing**
✅ Enabling **users to earn or top-up credits easily**
✅ Rewarding engagement with **bonus and referral credits**
✅ Allowing **admins to track and allocate usage across teams**

---

## 👥 Who It’s For
- **Individual Users:** Freelancers, students, and professionals who use AI tools within Telex.  
- **Team Leads & Workspace Admins:** Who want visibility and control over AI usage across their teams.  
- **Developers & Module Creators:** Who can monetize their features through the AI credit system.  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Credit Wallet:** Users have a virtual wallet showing available AI credits.
- **AI Usage Tracking:** Each AI action deducts credits dynamically.
- **Top-Up System:** Multiple payment gateways (Paystack, Stripe) integrated for purchasing credits.
- **Referral Rewards:** Users earn bonus credits through referrals.
- **Usage Analytics Dashboard:** Track consumption trends and predict top-ups.
- **Developer Integration API:** Allow third-party modules to plug into the credit system.
